Challenges for Practice
Challenge 1: Multi-Service Metrics

Create a dataset with CPU, memory, and disk usage for multiple services.
Aggregate metrics and find the most resource-intensive service.
Challenge 2: Log Correlation

Analyze logs from multiple servers and correlate downtime events with error spikes.
Challenge 3: Anomaly Detection

Use a rolling average or exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) to detect anomalies in time-series data.
Challenge 4: SLA Analysis

Simulate a dataset with latency and availability data for multiple endpoints.
Calculate SLA compliance for each endpoint.
Challenge 5: Incident Analysis

Combine logs and monitoring metrics to identify the root cause of a simulated incident.
