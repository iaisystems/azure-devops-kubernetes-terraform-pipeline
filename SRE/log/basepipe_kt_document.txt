# KT Document: BasePipe Class for List Processing

## Purpose
- The `BasePipe` class simplifies list operations like sorting, filtering, and mapping.
- The `main` function demonstrates the use of this class with a sample data set.

## Key Components
1. **Class: `BasePipe`**
   - **`sorted(self, key, reverse)`**: Re-sorts the data based on a key or in reverse order.
   - **`filter(self, f)`**: Filters data based on a function `f`.
   - **`map(self, f)`**: Maps a function `f` to all elements.
   - **`get_top(self)`**: Retrieves the first element.
   - **`find_first(self, f)`**: Finds the first element matching a condition.
   - **`find_last(self, f)`**: Finds the last element matching a condition.

2. **Function: `main`**
   - Demonstrates:
     - Filtering a list of dictionaries.
     - Finding the first and last matches based on a condition.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- A list-like input for the `BasePipe` class.

## Usage Instructions
1. Replace `optimus_history` with your data set.
2. Use the `BasePipe` class to process your data with various operations.
