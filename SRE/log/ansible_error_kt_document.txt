# KT Document: Python Script for Parsing Ansible Errors from ELK Logs

## Purpose
- This script is designed to identify and debug Ansible job failures by interacting with the ELK stack.
- It automates log retrieval, parsing, and error detection for faster troubleshooting.

## Modules/Functions Overview
1. **`get_ansible_error(url)`**
   - Fetches Ansible error logs from a given URL.
   - Identifies and returns fatal errors found in the logs.

2. **`get_ansible_error_from_elk(desc, task_start_time)`**
   - Parses the job description to extract the Ansible job number.
   - Fetches associated ELK logs for error detection.

3. **`is_ansible_error(log)`**
   - Extracts the Ansible job number from a log URL.
   - Returns the job number for further analysis.

4. **`get_elk_errorlog(job, start_time)`**
   - Fetches ELK logs for a specific Ansible job.
   - Handles time formatting for accurate queries.

5. **`get_elk_towerlog(cls, job)`**
   - Searches the ELK stack for specific tower logs related to an Ansible job.

6. **`main()`**
   - Demonstrates the workflow by:
     - Parsing a description log for Ansible job numbers.
     - Fetching and analyzing the corresponding ELK logs.

## Dependencies
- Python modules: `logging`, `datetime`.
- Connection to an ELK stack instance.
- Log description format for job identification.

## Inputs and Outputs
- **Input**: Log descriptions, job numbers, and query parameters for ELK.
- **Output**: Parsed logs, error messages, or job IDs.

## Usage Instructions
1. Update the `desc` variable with your log details in the `main()` function.
2. Replace the `dummy_error_log` and `mocked_response` placeholders with actual logic.
3. Run the script to identify errors and debug Ansible jobs.
